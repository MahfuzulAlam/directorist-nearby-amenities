# Directorist Custom Code

The best way to implement custom code and override templates for the Directorist plugin.

## How to Override Directorist Template Files?

To override Directorist template files, place the file in the same directory structure as it is found in the Directorist plugin's template folder.

### Example:

If you want to override the `address` field in the single listing page, place `address.php` in the following path:

`wp-content/plugins/directorist-custom-code/templates/single/fields/address.php`

Ensure the directory structure matches exactly to successfully override the template.
